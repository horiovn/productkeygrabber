This product key grabber launches from a USB thumb drive, searches for the current product key and Windows version, and logs them. For example, "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX" "Windows 10 Home." While running, it also grabs the current IPV4 and logs it into "InformationLog.txt," along with the current username, device name, timestamp and other features included with version of release.
